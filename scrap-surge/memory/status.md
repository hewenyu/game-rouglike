# Status
User played and rejected Nightfold: not satisfying, wants a Brotato-like roguelike.
The rejected prototype has been deleted under the user's direct authorization.
Current project: Scrap Surge, a scrap-armored hermit crab with automatic multi-weapons.

Product goal lives in memory/goal.md: an original, runnable, replayable single-player
browser auto-combat roguelike targeting a 10-20 minute normal run with genuine
positive-feedback builds. The user's latest goal supersedes the older "stop before
demonstrating" note; the two-wave build is now the first slice toward that goal.

## Roles
Astra coordinates, owns architecture boundaries and integration review; Opus reviews
gameplay/aesthetics/feel; DeepSeek is the sole writer here (implementation, tests,
fixes). All three have equal standing and must explicitly agree before a decision is
implemented. Silence is not approval. Author self-check is not independent review;
the independent DeepSeek review runs in a separate context against a frozen commit.

## Slice S1 (approved by Astra, Opus and DeepSeek)
Feel-validation slice: 20-second wave 1, shop, 35-second wave 2 with boss, real touch
movement. Approved revision package: player ivory+teal color separation at 1.3x with
white outline and teal ground ring; visible weapon blocks; fixed wave spawn rates
(3.1/s and 4.2/s) plus timed enemy pockets; high-saturation explosion FX with a real
chain count and number merging; non-blocking HUD; high-contrast shop feedback-loop
diagram; title-sticker clipping fix; and the combatPicked / FIFO boundary rules.
Also agreed: S1b (spring-fist remnant, overtime countdown, per-root chain accounting,
success-only spawn counting) and S1c (presentation-only readability fixes). The
explicit per-agent sign-off text lives in docs/reviews.md.

S1 + S1b + S1c are implemented and frozen on branch codex/scrap-surge at the commit
recorded below. Evidence at that freeze: `npm test` 35/35 (the suite has since grown
to 37 with S1d, below), `npm run build` clean,
`npm run test:browser` victory (283 kills, hp 1, chain peak 19, pending peak 14, no
page errors) and an author-run `npm run test:browser:regression` 19/19 including the
idle-play defeat path and the arena-vs-HUD geometry checks. The checks were drafted by a
separate agent, but the implementer ran them, so that is author evidence, not
independent review. Frozen slice review by Astra, Opus and an isolated DeepSeek
reviewer is pending and must run against the frozen source commit.

This is a feel-validation slice, not a claim of a finished 10-20-minute game.
User acceptance of this version is still pending.

## Current source under review

The current source on branch codex/scrap-surge is baseline **ee53cf8** (the
post-palette-restore slice) plus the S1d damage change, frozen by the commit whose
subject begins "S1d:" (the freeze commit for that package).

The earlier frozen slice **21a18fd66f782c8239ec6511897c66da9c58fe5a**
("scrap-surge: freeze S1/S1b/S1c feel slice", parent c502295) is historical. The
21a18fd review does **not** apply to ee53cf8 or to the S1d commit: the explosion
palette changed at ee53cf8 and the slinger damage changed at S1d. Astra, Opus and an
isolated DeepSeek reviewer must review the current S1d source commit.

Scope is exactly S1 + S1b + S1c + S1d. No other product scope is authorized.

## Recovery of the unapproved expansion (2026-10-19)

The previous implementer was interrupted while `src/data.ts`, `src/sim.ts` and
`src/render.ts` carried unapproved, uncommitted edits on `codex/scrap-surge` on top
of source `ee53cf8`. Astra, Opus and an independent DeepSeek review context each
performed a full review and all three explicitly agreed to isolate the extension as
a draft branch, return the working branch to the committed slice, and review the
extension in phases later. The extension is neither merged as-is nor discarded.

Disposition carried out:

- The three files were committed unchanged to branch
  `codex/scrap-surge-expansion-draft` as an explicitly unapproved, unintegrated WIP
  draft. **Draft SHA: 8e1542ebd8f8568bcdc9f2301050cd3f85acb6e0.**
- `codex/scrap-surge` is back on committed source `ee53cf8` with a clean working
  tree. The draft commit reproduces the exact pre-recovery contents, so the original
  file hashes remain recoverable:
  data.ts `501bc2e0…dd688ef3`, sim.ts `4bcd7bdb…8cb75c498`, render.ts `75426d4d…08ca488913`.
- `/tmp/scrap-audit-ofrJ1o` (extension patch + snapshot server) is auxiliary only;
  project reproduction must use the draft SHA, never `/tmp`.

Blockers and open items are recorded in docs/reviews.md: B1 (main shop `chooseMod`,
two-wave UI and missing anchor icon still make the first shop error and block the
next wave), B2 (snapshot `npm test` 32/36 and a TypeScript build failure from a stale
Gun-level fixture), B3 (`wave2.hp` 1.35 really moves runner 19->26 / can 75->101 and
bossborn 0.65->1.2), the barrel/saw/echo new-mechanism issues, the valuable wave
table / weapon merging / new enemies that need a separate sign-off package, the
`qaStart` non-cheat note, the `refine` economy review, and the three-party-agreed S1d
fast gun 18->20 (now implemented; see below). `ee53cf8` is the post-palette-restore
slice; the old `21a18fd` review does not apply to this SHA.

## Slice S1d (approved by Astra, Opus and DeepSeek) - implemented 2026-10-19

S1d changes exactly one number: the initial can-popper (`slinger`) damage 18 -> 20 in
`src/data.ts`. No other value, mechanic, UI or draft code changed.

Numeric impact on the current two-wave build:

- A wave-1 runner has 19 hp, so one slinger hit now kills it (20 >= 19). At 18 damage
  it needed two hits. Wave-2 runners also have 19 hp, so the same one-hit kill holds
  there.
- A can has 75 hp, so it now dies in four slinger hits instead of five
  (`ceil(75/20) = 4` vs `ceil(75/18) = 5`).

Evidence: `npm test` 37/37. A new test pins `WEAPONS.slinger.damage === 20`, the
one-hit runner kill (exactly one hit, one kill) and the can's three-hits-alive /
four-hits-dead boundary. `npm run build` is clean. Astra's first-shop browser review
is saved into the repo as `tests/browser-first-shop.mjs`
(`npm run test:browser:first-shop`) for reproducibility; the browser matrix and the
independent review run after this freeze, not here.

This is still a two-wave feel-validation slice. There is **no user playtest
acceptance** of this or any version yet.
